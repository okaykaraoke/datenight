I’m sat at a table outside an old bar on a wide Berlin street in Mitte. As an Englishman everything about the scene to me is quintessentially European. If I squint through the door into the dimly lit interior panelled with dark wood I could be looking back in time. There’s an unkempt elderly man with a thousand yard stare and wiry white moustaches smoking hand rolled cigarettes at a table inside. Outside two large and haughty looking young German men are clean shaven, looking both commanding and camp in their leather jackets. They sip slowly from their kleine pils and say very little. Opposite us is a large and beautiful gothic looking church with a tall dark spire. A clean tram rolls around the corner every 7 minutes. 
 
My date has just returned from a call that she excused herself to make immediately on arrival. She explains to me now that she’s had some news from her sister. It’s not good news but touch wood it could be worse. She raps her knuckles on the wood of the table quickly for luck and I copy her, or so I thought. 

“No, upwards”

“Sorry?”

“Up! Upwards from underneath so things go up from here”

“Ohh” and I correct my mistake by rapping again but on the underside of the wooden table. So that things go up for her. 

I am not a superstitious person, quite the opposite, but I enjoy it when this eccentric woman tells me about all of hers. They’re quaintly interesting — little anthropological factoids that paint a vivid picture of her background — I wasn’t about to roll my eyes and start a roaring debate about critical thinking and the scientific method. At the same time though I am deeply skeptical of anyone who takes superstitions seriously. It’s a hang-up of mine, no doubt about it. The world is a richer place for all of our wonderful differences and I wouldn’t have it any other way, granted. However, I am going to think you’re weird if we don’t share the same level of confidence that a black cat is just a cat and not also a portent of imminent doom.

“We’re a deeply superstitious people in Bosnia”

“Is that so?”

“We have so many superstitions. So many. It’s crazy” she tells me with a wry laugh and leaning in: “and I consider myself a sort of witch who can tell things. I know when things are good, I know when they’re bad”. 

She’s rolling a cigarette as she tells me this and laughs a little nervously “I don’t have a bad feeling”. 

Ira is from Sarajevo. Her voice is artificially deep when she speaks with plenty of vocal fry. She’s been in Berlin 8 years and tells me the people of Berlin are rude. Terribly rude. 

“After 8 years I know. They’re rude. I say to people at the start - no Berliners are not rude everyone is so nice - I am wrong. As you are wrong now.”

I ask her if she wants to end the date early because of the news about her sister. 

“No I’m fine it’s fine. We don’t, any of us, in our family have cancer. Never. Good genes. We’ll continue. Where are you from?”

The waitress interrupts and invites us to order and I begin to say are you sure but get rebuffed before I can properly get the words out, so turning and bumbling I say to the busy German waitress “Yes– Ja... please, I’d like eine Radler, bitte” sounding like a pillock.

“I’m going to have a Moscow mule” says my date before sucking down the last of her quick cigarette freeing up her hands to immediately roll another. Small-talk follows.

Between exchanging the usual facts about what we do and why we’re here Ira takes three more calls. 

While she isn't talking on the phone, messages are appearing rapidly. Returning from the restroom I notice WhatsApp and the black and white ultrasound scans of her sister’s uterus. I don’t know what to say. 

“I’m sending results to a family friend. He’s an oncologist”. 

“For a second opinion? That’s good.” 

“Everyone is very close at home. The whole family but not only the family even friends. They all talk. If one person is worried everyone is worried.” 

“I see”

“It’s too much.”

Against this backdrop, somehow, there is still a date happening. We even flirted. We talked about dating in Berlin vs. dating in London. What we’re looking for. What we've found. Sex and connection. She has a new desire to have sex with someone she has no connection with and reflects that it will take no small amount of courage to be vulnerable like that, and maybe that's why. She fixes me with a penetrating stare. I blink first. As she tells me these things her loose fitting jumper slips off one shoulder and she noticed me noticing her lean in to reveal cleavage and bra. But I also keep looking at her phone.

Eventually her doctor friend reassured her that it could be anything. She tells me detailed facts about the results, precise numbers, what threshold hadn’t been met and how that was good. The relief quickly brings up a well of tears in Ira’s deep brown eyes and I realise that her odd manner was perhaps a symptom of shock. As the date draws to a close I feel a ripple of guilt and admit silently that I’ve been holding back because I suspected this sad story wasn't all true. I don't know why, I just had a bad feeling. Call it superstition.

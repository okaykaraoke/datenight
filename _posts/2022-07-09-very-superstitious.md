I’m sat at a table outside an old fashioned bar on a wide Berlin street in Mitte. As an Englishman everything about the scene is quintessentially European. If I squint through the door into the dimly lit and dark wood panelled interior I could be looking back in time. There’s an unkempt elderly man with a thousand yard stare and wiry white moustaches smoking hand rolled cigarettes at a table inside. Outside at the table adjacent to mine two large and haughty looking young German men are clean shaven and look both commanding and camp in their leather jackets. They sip slowly from their kleine pils and say very little. On the opposite side of this leafy street is a large and beautiful gothic looking church with a tall dark spire. A clean tram rolls around the corner every 7 minutes. 
 
My date has just returned from a call that she excused herself to make immediately on arrival and explains to me now that she’s had some news from her sister. It’s not good news but touch wood it could be worse. She raps her knuckles on the wood of the table quickly for luck and I copy her, or so I thought. 

“No, upwards”

“Sorry?”

“Up! Upwards from underneath so things go up from here”

“Ohh” and I correct my mistake by rapping again but on the underside of the wooden table. So that things go up for her. 

I am not a superstitious person, quite the opposite, but I enjoy hearing about new superstitions from this eccentric woman. They’re quaintly interesting to me — who doesn’t love a little anthropological factoid? — I certainly wasn’t about to roll my eyes and start a roaring debate about critical thinking and the scientific method. At the same time though I am deeply skeptical of anyone who takes superstitions remotely seriously. It’s my hang-up I’m perfectly willing to admit that. The world is a richer place for all of our wonderful differences and I wouldn’t have it any other way, granted. However, I am going to think you’re weird if we don’t share the same level of confidence that a black cat is just a cat and not also a portent of imminent doom.

“We’re a deeply superstitious people in Bosnia”

“Is that so?”

“We have so many superstitions. So many. It’s crazy” she tells me with a wry laugh and leaning in: “and I consider myself a sort of witch who can tell things. I know when things are good, I know when they’re bad”. 

She’s rolling a cigarette as she tells me this and laughs a little nervously “I don’t have a bad feeling”. 

Ira is from Sarajevo. Her voice is artificially deep when she speaks, with plenty of vocal fry. She’s been in berlin 8 years and tells me the people of Berlin are rude. Terribly rude. “After 8 years I know. They’re rude. I say to people at the start - no Berliners are not rude everyone is so nice - I am wrong. As you are wrong now.” 

I ask her if she wants to end the date early because of the news about her sister. 

“No I’m fine it’s fine. We don’t, any of us, in our family have cancer. Never. Good genes. We’ll continue. Where are you from?”

The waitress interrupts and invites us to order and I begin to say are you sure but get rebuffed before I can properly get the words out so I turn bumbling and say to the busy German waitress “Yes– Ja... please, I’d like eine Radler, bitte” sounding like a pillock.

“I’m going to have a Moscow mule” says my date before sucking down the last of her quick cigarette freeing up her hands to immediately roll another. 

Ira’s phone has been going off frequently. She opens WhatsApp and the black and white ultrasound scans of her sister’s uterus flash up. I don’t know what to say. 

“I’m sending results to a family friend. He’s an oncologist”. 

“For a second opinion? That’s good.” 

“Everyone is very close at home. The whole family but not only the family even friends. They all talk. If one person is worried everyone is worried.” 

“I see”

“It’s too much.”

Between exchanging the usual facts about what we do and why we’re here Ira takes three more calls. 

There was a brief period where we flirted. We talked about dating in Berlin and dating in London. What we’re looking for. Sex and connection. Her desire to have sex with someone she does not yet have a connection with and the bravery that it will take. As she tells me these things her loose fitting jumper slips off one shoulder and she noticed me noticing her lean in to reveal cleavage and bra. But I also keep looking at her phone.

Eventually her doctor friend reassured her that it could be anything. She tells me detailed facts about the results, precise numbers, what threshold hadn’t been met and how that was good. The relief quickly brings up a well of tears in Ira’s deep brown eyes and I realise that her odd manner was perhaps a symptom of shock and as the date draws to a close I feel a ripple of guilt as I admit silently that I’ve been holding back because I half suspected this sad story might not have been true. I couldn’t tell you why, I just had a bad feeling.
